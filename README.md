<h1><strong>#️⃣ Dear Judges of Buildathon-2</strong></h1>


I'm writing to share a bit of background about my submission, **VibeCode**.

This idea has been in my mind for a while—I had already begun outlining and exploring it before the Buildathon was announced. But once I learned about **Buildathon-2**, I decided to pause my work and officially begin building it as part of this event to give it the time and attention it deserves.

Since I've built and deployed several AI-based web applications before, I'm **reusing essential logic and components** from my earlier work—specifically for chatbot functionality, API integrations, voice/text input handling, and LLM response parsing. This helps me focus on rapid development and polish during the Buildathon itself.

## ♻️ Projects I'm Reusing Code or Logic From

Here are a few of my earlier AI-powered projects from which I’ve reused some backend logic and design patterns:

### 🔬 [VitalScans.AI](https://github.com/BENi-Aditya/VitalScans.AI)
> Upload X-ray scans to detect lung diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis, along with bone fracture detection.

### 🥗 [NutriScan.AI](https://github.com/BENi-Aditya/BENi_AI_Nutritional_Tracker)
> Scan packaged food items to instantly get nutritional information, check for allergens, and track expiry dates using barcodes and AI.

These projects gave me a solid foundation in working with **LLMs**, **real-time inference pipelines**, and **AI-enhanced UI/UX flows**, all of which I’m adapting to fit **VibeCode’s** goals.
